title: 2020 is already here, time flies ... 
---
  Exactly a year ago, I wrote a post summarizing my year, and my goals for 2019. Here, we are, we successfully consumed 2019, and saw the sunlight at 2020. First and foremost, I am grateful that me and my family are all healthy and alive, and I can only pass my best wishes to those who lost their beloved ones during the last year. 
  
  2019 has been a fast-changing year for me in that the company I work for (Borealis AI) moved to a new organizational model, i.e. integrated model where fundamental researchers and applied team co-work on the projects. Previously I worked as a researcher on the fundamental team, and I was only expected to conduct research to publish and generate IP through patents, etc. The switch has been a little bit abrupt, but I can confidently say that I survived the transition process. I can still do some research, but mostly, through interns. Working on the product side also has its own pros and cons, and I plan to write a seperate blogpost on this subject later. 
  
  To be continoued ...
