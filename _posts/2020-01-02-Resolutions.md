title: Welcome 2020  
---
  Exactly a year ago, I wrote a post summarizing my year, and my goals for 2019. Here, we are, we successfully consumed 2019, and saw the sunlight at 2020. First and foremost, I am grateful that me and my family are all healthy, and I can only pass my best wishes to those who lost their beloved ones during the last year. 
  
  2019 has been a fast-changing year for me from a professional perspective in that the company I work for (Borealis AI) moved to a new organizational model, i.e. integrated model where fundamental researchers and applied team co-work on the projects. Previously I worked as a researcher on the fundamental team, and I was only expected to conduct research to publish and generate IP through patents, etc. The switch has been a little bit abrupt, but I can confidently say that I survived the transition process. I can still do some research, but mostly, through great interns that mostly come from University of Alberta. Working on the product side also has its own advantages and disadvantages, and I plan to write a seperate blogpost on this subject later.
  
  Last year, I attended a few academic conferences, i.e. really great to both catch up old friends & colleques, but also meet lots of new people in the exponentially growing AI field. AAAI-19 took place in Hawaii, where particularly "Reinforcement Learning in Games" workshop was a blast. I will try to attend this workshop again in AAAI-20 in New York in February. I personally like AAAI more than other core ML conferences in that AAAI managed to not overfit to the current pure ML hype, thus one still gets to see other classical AI based approaches. I and my collaguea, Christopher Srinivasa, wrote a [blogpost](https://www.borealisai.com/en/blog/everything-old-new-again-tackling-classical-problems-modern-techniques-aaai-2019/) on AAAI-2019 last year. I also attended RLDM-19 conference in Montreal, i.e. awesome to meet broader RL community. More recently, I attended AIIDE-19 conference to present our papers in Atlanta. AIIDE is awesome in that it is a single-track conference with smaller audience, but it includes diverse work, e.g. regarding computational creativity or human-AI interaction. It is not as tiring as extremely large conferences, but one gets to chat in depth on areas of interest with great researchers.
  
  My goals for 2020 are numerous: I would like to continue to my momentum in physical exercising, read at least 30 books during the year, try to keep up with the state-of-the-art research in RL, and travel to new places with my family.
  
  I conclude with nothing but my best wishes for peace and health to everyone, especially to the Middle East area where I hail from (Istanbul). 2020 might have not started perfectly, but I hope world-leaders act more responsibly for stability. Finishing with a quote from M. Kemal Ataturk "Peace at Home, Peace in the World".
