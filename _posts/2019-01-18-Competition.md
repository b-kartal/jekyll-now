In this post, I will share my experiences for a recent multi-agent RL competition (Pommerman) that we participated at NeurIPS-2018. Even though, I only attended one such competition so far, I will try to generalize by assuming many aspects will be similar for competitions in different fields. I will decompose the benefits into multiple categories, and detail them.

### Mastering Skills:

Competitions have deadlines. Deadlines causes some amount of hopefully healthy stress and pressure which can further improve our learning performance. Within the limited available time, we need to come up with ideas that we can quickly execute, test, and revise. For my case, I needed to adapt several different methods before getting enough intuition about the problem, i.e. unique challenges, dynamics, and pitfalls. I was able to learn several new methods, and master already known ones quickly.

### Meeting the Community:

In general, competitions comes with some online communities where participants and organizers are constantly interacting. This is very useful for many reasons: (i) you might get collaboration chances with others, (ii) you can reach a better solution by also accessing others’ failure experiences related with methods or frameworks.

### Publicity:

This is the most obvious and quick yield of performing well in competitions. Good competition performance might attract employers. This is especially good for people on the job market. It might be even for more helpful for those who cannot pass screening process due to several existing barriers e.g. immigration, having no formal degree or a degree from a university unknown to the country the candidate is interested in.

### Being a Citizen Scientist:

Even though some competitions might be organized for fun, AI/ML/Robotics competitions are generally designed and setup to gather more ideas or out-of-the-box solutions for some open industry related problems. In a way, each participant acts as a citizen scientist. For example, DARPA Grand Challenge started a new research/engineering frontier which greatly accelerated the development of commercial autonomous cars.

### Engineering Issues:

Even though, I motivate and encourage participation in competitions for all the perspectives listed above, if main interest is to be on top-k on the leaderboard, then there are some resource related challenges. For particularly AI projects, where one has infinitely many degrees of freedom to tune, it might be computationally costly. This also lures researchers to spend more time with software rather than ideas or fundamental concepts. For example, the winner of the Open AI Retro contest did not come up with a new method or framework. Indeed, they employed a baseline method provided by Open AI with some modifications and tuning.

### Summary:

Competitions are rewarding for several purposes such as meeting other people interested in the same kinds of problems, mastering skills, and gaining publicity in case of performing well. But, one also has to be aware that participant is highly likely solving somebody’s hidden problem, and competitions are by nature very similar to applied projects, i.e. there will be many engineering oriented low-level problems one has to solve to put everything together.
