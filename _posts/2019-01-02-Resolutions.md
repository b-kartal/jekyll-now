title: Welcome 2019 and Resolutions …
---

I would like to step back and summarize my 2018. We moved to Edmonton in Canada and I started to work at Borealis AI as a machine learning researcher. After a few years break, I started to exercise again thanks to a next-door Gym. I learnt a great deal of reinforcement learning this year. I visited Montreal and Quebec city with my family and we really loved it. We recently participated NeurIPS-2018 Pommerman competition, and ranked the 2nd in learning agents category. Overall, I must say that 2018 has treated me very well. I learnt a lot, I worked on challenging and fun problems, and I collaborated with great people.

As they say, time flies. I think long term success will be upon those who can keep improving their skill-set independent of current trends despite all the deadlines and low hanging fruits for trendy topics and those who can actively read both within and beyond their expertise areas. Given this proposition, I would like to make some plans for 2019. Firstly, I plan to read the recently released RL book by Rich Sutton by actively completing all the exercises. I think this won’t be hard to achieve. All I need to do is to read less of most recent RL papers on arxiv that pours everyday!. Secondly, I plan to read at least two books each month. I started a goodreads account for this. Lastly, I will try to attend at least one technical talk a week, i.e. not necessarily in my own research area. Being close to University of Alberta, Startup Edmonton, and AMII will help me for this goal.

Even though I only mentioned my career goals for 2019, there are more important things in our lives. I would like to keep spending high quality time with my family and I hope to travel to new places I have never been.

I wish you a great year with health and happiness, and hopefully success.
