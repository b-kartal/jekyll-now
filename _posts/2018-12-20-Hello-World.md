title: Hello World!

I always wanted to have a blog page, and always procrastinated. There are lots of things going on in my life in both technical and non-technical perspectives. I would like to take the initiative and start writing here. The content will be mixed of whatever I feel like to write about.

Thanks for reading, and as a reader you are very welcome to provide feedback.
