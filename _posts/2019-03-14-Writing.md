I mostly write papers for academic ven1ues: conferences and journals. This writing style is very structured and one has to choose the correct words so that the presented work neither overclaims or underclaims the value of the work.

One of the reasons I started to write blog posts is to improve my writing abilities. Sometimes, dissimilar to academic writing, I try to write in an unstructured fashion similar to this blog-post so that my general writing skill is also sharpened.

I also think that writing process might transform our thoughts in a way that we can better understand. This is similar to teaching a concept, which forces the person to think about the material deeper or from different perspectives, and thus improves the teacher’s own understanding of the material. Recognizing this, I started to write continuously rather than deadline-driven writing. This helped me in multiple ways: (i) I get more concrete and broader research plans/directions while writing a draft of very-ongoing early work, and (ii) it helps me better grasp what I haven’t really understood on the ongoing research work.

I think if one can’t write a short and clear description of a technical method, one reason can be that the material is not well absorbed/understood.
