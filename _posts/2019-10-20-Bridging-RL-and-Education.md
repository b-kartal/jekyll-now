In this post, I would like to brainstorm a few speculative ideas at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and education fields. The plan for the post is as follows: (i) a brief background, (ii) some existing RL approaches that can be categorized at this intersection, and (iii) more open-ended discussion of what else can be done for better RL agents.

RL problem deals with trial-error based learning to maximize rewards for sequential decision making problems. Fundamentally different than supervised learning where training data/label is given, RL agents create their own training data (consisting of agent-environment interactions and rewards signals) as they interact with their environments. Mathematical formulation of RL abstracts away many components as the agent in the end aims to maximize rewards for the task hand. 

One the other hand, education is defined as [the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners may also educate themselves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education). We can see that the definition of education provides several components that imply generalization naturally such as the notion of skills and habits.
